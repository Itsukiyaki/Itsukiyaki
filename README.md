### :seedling: Eldi Muhamad S - Data Scientist | Data Analyst
---
ðŸ‘‹ Hi There!  
I'm Eldi, a Data Analyst with a biology academic background and a strong interest in data-driven decision-making. My transition into the data field began after graduating with a Bachelor of Science in 2020, when I discovered a growing passion for analyzing patterns and solving real-world problems through data.

To build on this interest, I completed the full-time Data Science Bootcamp at Hacktiv8, where I gained hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and Tableau. Through projects involving exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and dashboard development, Iâ€™ve developed the practical skills needed to transform complex datasets into actionable insights and clear visual reports that support strategic business outcomes.
